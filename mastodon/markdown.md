# Awoo d'etat
## Mastodon, the Twitter with no Nazis
Dan Conley



## Announcement
I'm taking it as a given that Nazis are bad. I don't this this is a particularly controversial statement. I try to avoid being *explicitly* political at work, but I feel like no matter what you political beliefs we can come together and agree that Nazis, like actual literal Nazis in the year of our lord two thousand and seventeen with the swastikas and the white supremacy and all that, are bad.

This isn't entirely about how bad Nazis are but really, they're so bad! Wanted to get that out of the way.


## Okay one sec then it'll be out of my system

## I love Twitter
* I've been using it since 2007
* User number 815,545
* I remember when the hashtag was social convention and not supported, whippersnapper!


## But Twitter has a problem
* Lots of harassment
* Like, lots
* I've avoided it for whatever reason, probably because I'm too boring, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen


## Plus, capitalism ruins everything
* Ads!
* Analytics!
* If you aren't the customer, you're the product



## Enter Mastodon

## Masto!
* Decentralized microblogging platform (do people still say microblogging?)
* You join an _instance_, which federates your posts to other instances
* Host your own or join an existing one
* Actually a fork of [GNU social](https://gnu.io/social/) (and can federate with them)


## Oh, like diaspora\*?
* Twitter:Mastodon::Facebook:diaspora\*, definitely
* Except people actually use Mastodon



## Benefits of Mastodon
* Defaults to 500 characters per toot
* Did I mention posts/tweets are called toots?

## Benefits of Mastodon: content warnings
* You can mark images as sensitive, and give text a content warning (with customizable title)
* Designed to hide potentially triggering things like abuse, violence, drug use, etc
* That would be enough on its own to be noteworthy!
* I wish I had CWs everywhere, including Hipchat


## Other uses of content warnings
* Spoilers
* Things people might not care about (ie Eurovision)
* Jokes! (cw text is setup, hidden text is punchline)



## Security concerns
* All your data, including direct/private messages, are readable by your admin
* Private posts can be viewed by anyone who _follows you_, not _your followers_
* Other instances might not respect toot privacy, etc
* If a private post federated to another instance, _that_ admin can read it


## These aren't dealbreakers: data privacy
* Twitter/Facebook/etc have all your data too!
* And the trans French Communist woman who runs my instance is _much_ less likely to sell me out than @jack
* It's always good to think about privacy, so I like having this conversation


## These aren't dealbreakers: federation
* You can set your account to approve followers
* Only sending private messages to your instance keeps it on your instance
* If you run your own instance you have complete control (though that's a lot of effort)
* An instance admin can defederate with another instance



## It was my understanding that there would be no Nazis
* For the most part, yes
* Each instance has its own code of conduct, ranging from "we don't have a code of conduct" to a strictly moderated one
* mastodon.social, the flagship instance, explicitly bans "Content illegal in Germany and/or France"
* My experience has no Nazis, because my instance and every one it federates with prohibits it
* "But free spee-" "freedom of speech" isn't "guaranteed a platform", and I'm sure there are plenty of instances that would be happy to have you


## Each instance has its own culture
* Partly because of self selection: you choose an instance that fits your likes/personality
* Little things: cybre.space upped the max character limit to 512, witches.town to 666
* tenforward.social isn't _just_ a Star Trek roleplay instance, but it has that
* oulipo.social prevents any toot with the letter 'e' dolphin.town _only_ allows 'e' and spaces
* You can sign up for as many as you want, keeping your furry stuff to awoo.space and your selfies to selfy.army and... etc



## Okay I want to awoo
* Don't awoo, $350 penalty (this is a joke I don't really understand it I think it's a furry thing I just play along)
* Also, [pineapples for some reason](https://mastodon.social/@acw/1597644)
* Don't join mastodon.social: this isn't Twitter! There isn't one place Where Mastodon Is
* [instances.mastodon.xyz](https://instances.mastodon.xyz/) will help you find one
* My biased list: witches.town, toot.cat, awoo.space, cybre.space, glitch.social, cute.group, computerfairi.es and anything else I mentioned here
