# Scoutbook
Dan Conley

August 2019


## A quick note
I wrote this to present to my pack, but will also be posting it online. Which is why I focus on Cub Scouts, adventures, etc.



## What is a scout book?
* A website! [http://scoutbook.com/](http://scoutbook.com/)

* Track advancement, schedule events, send messages, plan meetings

* A scout's advancement stays with them from Lion up to Eagle


## Who is it for?
* Unit leaders: see how scouts are progressing, print purchase orders, submit advancement reports, send messages, etc
	* I've been using Scoutbook since it went free in January and have really been liking it (UX notwithstanding)

* Den Leaders: track advancement, plan meetings
	* Schedule adventure requirements 1, 2, 3A, 3C for a meeting. Mark who was at the meeting and _boom_, it's recorded!


## Who is it for?
* Parents: "what do they even _do_ at meetings?" and also "we did this adventure at home, can my scout get credit for it?"

* Scouts! BSA, not Cubs. Enter what they did on their own. Messages to scouts auto-CC parents so there's no 1-on-1 digital contact.



# What can you do?


## Tracking advancement
* Enter individually or in bulk (easiest to do from the Den page)

* Or do from the calendar (a few slides down)

* Once earned they have to be approved by the den leader (or Cubmaster, if it's a rank)


## Tracking advancement
* The advancement chair can print a purchase order that lists exactly what to buy and how many, groups by den, estimates price, etc

* Then you can mark each item as _awarded_, to prevent "we have one of these belt loops left, who wasn't at last week's meeting?"

* You can also mark as awarded right away and skip the rest of the steps


## See everything earned

## Planning meetings
> Also new in Scoutbook for den leaders, now the Cub Scout required adventures for each rank have been thoughtfully organized into roughly 12 meetings, making planning out meetings for the year simpler than ever.

## Planning meetings
* I can't... actually get this to work

* But! _In theory_: [https://leader.scouting.org/](https://leader.scouting.org/)

* Note that this _only_ works on mobile. Not desktop.


## Calendar
* A separate calendar for each den, and the pack

* Subscribe to each in your calendar app of choice

* And this way Google doesn't have our info!

<small>I mean, Amazon probably does, because half the internet is hosted on AWS, but I digress</small>



# Things we don't use


## Money
* Apparently you can keep track of income/expenses for a scout/family (like camping, popcorn, reimbursements) and generate invoices

* Christina's method seems to be working for her so I'm not going to mess with it


## Parent-submitted adventures
* You can do things at home, outside of pack/den activities. You don't *have* to, but you can.

* I don't know exactly how to submit things but I know it's possible.
