# Protecting your privacy online

# Part 1: Philosophical improvements



## The internet is a big place
* Just because you don't think anyone *will* look at something you post doesn't mean they *can't* (and won't)
* Everything you post publicly is available forever
* (mostly)
* It's okay to be a stupid, goofy kid online! But do it in a way that won't haunt you as an adult.
* This does not include hate speech/harassment. Those are never okay. Be better.
* Privacy settings are a door. Close it. Let in people you want.


## "if you've got nothing to hide..."
* That's nonsense.
* TODO more



## You matter
* (We interrupt this presentation for a brief motivational speech)
* "I don't have anything worth stealing" - yes, you do
* Identity. Credit history. *Friends*. (we'll talk about Facebook in a bit)



## Your place in a group matters
* Computers let us crunch lots of data very quickly.



# Part 2: Practical improvements



# Get rid of Facebook


## Since you're going to ignore me and use Facebook anyway
* Check. Your. Privacy. Settings.
* Set everything to friends only
* Friends-of-friends means that all it takes is for one person to accept a rando for you to be exposed
* Don't accept requests from people you don't know! It's just Facebook.
* Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) (explained in a bit)



<h1>Stop using Google</h1>
<ul class="fragment">
<li>ibid</li>
<li>but they have... a lot of data</li>
<li>they don't look at it, but still</li>
<li>they are not your friend</li>
<li>(TODO: alternative software site)</li>
</ul>



## If you don't use a site, delete your account
* Data breaches happen!
* If your data isn't there, it won't be in the breach



# Use a password manager


## Stop using bad passwords
* Having a post-it or entry in your Notes app is *very bad*
* Someone gets that note and they have all your passwords
* Having the same password for every site is *also very bad*
* Data breaches happen! If they have your email and a leaked password, they have access to *all your sites*
* It's not the "complexity" of the password, it's the length

## Password managers to the rescue!
* Let the manager generate a long, random password
* Autofill into the site: you never need to even know it
* Works on desktop and mobile


## Password manager options
TODO: add links

* LastPass (what I use)
* 1Password
* KeePass


## Using a password manager
TODO



# Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)


## Things happen
* Have I mentioned data breaches yet?
* What if having your password *wasn't enough* to get access?
* Check the whiteboard for my Google password
* Good luck using it


## An intro to 2FA
* It combines something you *know* (the password) with something you *have* (generally, a phone)
* A code is either texted to you or is displayed in an app
* No code, no login


## 2FA options
TODO: add links

* Google Authenticator
* LastPass Authenticator (what I use)
* Authy


## Adding a site to your 2FA manager
* Find it under "security", "password", etc
* It will show you a QR code
* Scan that with your app and you're all set
* Enter the code to be sure it works
* Generally you're given backup codes (store these somewhere *safe*)


## An important thing to remember about 2FA
* DO NOT RESET/GET RID OF YOUR PHONE
* That's how you get in to sites!
* If you get a new phone and didn't disable 2FA, now you can't get in
* This is where those backup codes help, or you can call support
* Some apps let you back up your codes, but that seems dicey



# Block trackers


## Cookies: more than a dessert
* My son was *so* disappointed at Take Your Kid To Work Day
* Cookies are how you stay logged in to websites
* But then can be more... *nefarious*
* If you look at a notebook on the Staples website, then go to a board game site and see an ad for that notebook, you can thank cookies


## Determining if a cookie is good or bad (without testing for raisins)
TODO links

* Privacy Badger
* Disconnect
* Also AdBlock Plus, but that blocks ads
* I'll let you determine if you want to support websites via their ad-based business model


## An axiom
If you don't pay for a website, you aren't the customer. You're the product.
