# Protecting your privacy online
Dan Conley

dconley@protonmail.com


## Two parts of this talk
1. Philosophical improvements: reconsider *how* and *why* you use the internet

2. Practical improvements: concrete things you can do to improve your privacy



# Part 1: Philosophical improvements



## The internet is a big place
* Just because you don't think anyone *will* look at something you post doesn't mean they *can't* (and won't)
* Everything you post publicly is available forever
* (mostly)


## The internet is a big place
* It's okay to be a stupid, goofy kid online! But do it in a way that won't haunt you as an adult.
* (This does not include hate speech/harassment. Those are never okay. Be better.)
* Privacy settings are a door. Close it. Let in people you want.


## You matter
* (We interrupt this presentation for a brief motivational speech)
* "I don't have anything worth stealing" - yes, you do
* Identity. Credit history. *Friends*. (we'll talk about Facebook in a bit)


## Your place in a group matters
* Computers let us crunch lots of data very quickly.
* Things that would be impossible to predict as a person can be done easily with computer data models
* Cambridge Analytica misused personal information from Facebook to create [253 predictions based on someone's data](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/may/06/cambridge-analytica-how-turn-clicks-into-votes-christopher-wylie)



## Think about what you post online
* Who can see it?
* Can it be taken out of context?
* Who *else* is involved, and are they okay with it being posted?
* Does it contain children?


## BSA has regulations
* [Guide to Safe Scouting](https://www.scouting.org/health-and-safety/gss/)
	* remember no 1x1 contact even electronically
	* cyberbullying

* [Social Media Guidelines](https://scoutingwire.org/social-media-guidelines/)
	* aimed at youth and adults
	* recommends keeping Facebook groups public, **but**
	* _are you posting private information of other people publicly?_
	* personally, I _never_ post pictures of my kids on a public feed: I wouldn't want my Pack/Troop to either


# Part 2: Practical improvements



# Get rid of Facebook


## Since you're going to ignore me and use Facebook anyway
* Check. Your. Privacy. Settings.
* Set everything to friends only
* Friends-of-friends means that all it takes is for one person to accept a rando for you to be exposed
* Don't accept requests from people you don't know! It's just Facebook.
* Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) (explained in a bit)



<h1>Stop using Google</h1>
<ul class="fragment">
	<li>ibid</li>
	<li>but they have... a lot of data</li>
	<li>they don't look at it, but still</li>
	<li>they are not your friend</li>
	<li>In general, <a href="https://switching.social/">switching.social</a> is a good site</li>
</ul>



## If you don't use a site, delete your account
* Data breaches happen!
* If your data isn't there, it won't be in the breach



# Use a password manager


## Stop using bad passwords
* Having a post-it or entry in your Notes app is *very bad*
* Someone gets that note and they have all your passwords
* Having the same password for every site is *also very bad*
* Data breaches happen! If they have your email and a leaked password, they have access to *all your sites*
* It's not the "complexity" of the password, it's the length


![xkcd 396, about password strength](password_strength.png)


## Password managers to the rescue!
* Let the manager generate a long, random password
* Autofill into the site: you never need to even know it
* Works on desktop and mobile


## Password manager options
* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) (what I use)
* [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)



# Use Two Factor Authentication (2FA)


## Things happen
* Have I mentioned data breaches yet?
* What if having your password *wasn't enough* to get access?
* Check the whiteboard for my Google password
* Good luck using it


## An intro to 2FA
* It combines something you *know* (the password) with something you *have* (generally, a phone)
* A code is either texted to you or is displayed in an app
* No code, no login


## 2FA options
* [Google Authenticator](https://google-authenticator.com/)
* [LastPass Authenticator](https://lastpass.com/auth/) (what I use)
* [Authy](https://authy.com/)


## Adding a site to your 2FA manager
* Find it under "security", "password", etc
* It will show you a QR code
* Scan that with your app and you're all set
* Enter the code to be sure it works
* Generally you're given backup codes (store these somewhere *safe*)


## An important thing to remember about 2FA
* DO NOT RESET/GET RID OF YOUR PHONE
* That's how you get in to sites!
* If you get a new phone and didn't disable 2FA, now you can't get in
* This is where those backup codes help, or you can call support
* Some apps let you back up your codes, but that seems dicey



# Block trackers


## Cookies: more than a dessert
* My son was *so* disappointed at Take Your Kid To Work Day
* Cookies are how you stay logged in to websites
* But then can be more... *nefarious*
* If you look at a notebook on the Staples website, then go to a board game site and see an ad for that notebook, you can thank cookies


## Determining if a cookie is good or bad (without testing for raisins)
* [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
* [Disconnect](https://disconnect.me/)
* Also [AdBlock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), but that blocks ads
	* I'll let you determine if you want to support websites via their ad-based business model


## An axiom
If you don't pay for a website, you aren't the customer. You're the product.


## More sinisterly...
> Stored personality characteristics may be used as targeting criteria for advertisers ... to increase the likelihood that the user . . . positively interacts with a selected advertisement

<p class="fragment">- <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US9740752B2/en">Facebook</a></p>



## Use a VPN
* Kind of out of scope
* Encrypts your web traffic and sends all request to a specific location
* Prevents your network from seeing the request; just the end network
* Useful for sending data to a different country (with less restrictive access and/or better privacy laws), or when using "free" airport wifi



# Closing thoughts


## I'm not trying to scare you
* I realize I sound like a fire and brimstone preacher
* _repent! repent your sinful tweets and your snapped chats! for a reckoning is at hand!_
* It's really easy to not realize how much information we're just giving away to people who may not do good things with it. I make mistakes too.


## Don't panic
* You can never be perfect. You can only be more perfect.

* Completely cutting Google, Amazon and Facebook out of your life is [nearly impossible at this point](https://gizmodo.com/i-cut-the-big-five-tech-giants-from-my-life-it-was-hel-1831304194)
